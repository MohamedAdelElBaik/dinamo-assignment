# Posts Management App

This is a simple posts management application built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to view, create, edit, and delete posts.

## How to Run the Application

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohamedAdelElBaik/dinamo-assignment.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Assumptions Made

- The backend API provides endpoints for CRUD operations on posts.
- Basic error handling is implemented for fetch, update, delete, and create operations.

## Challenges Faced

- Implementing dynamic pagination with proper handling for large datasets.
- Managing global state using `useReducer` and `useContext` effectively.
- Ensuring type safety with TypeScript throughout the project.

## Approximate Time Spent

Approximately **10 hours** were spent completing this assignment, including setup, development, testing, and debugging.
